###### **Formatting Guidelines:**

Please do your best to abide by the formatting below if you are creating new
setlist entries or modifying existing entries. This helps make our job as
moderators easier and keeps things looking nice!

  1. Please insert the following at the top of the page and modify **year** and **set name** for each set:
    
        [Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/bassnectar/wiki/index) > 
    [Setlists](./setlists/) > 
    [2019](./setlists/2019.md) > Deja Voom Night 1
    
    ###Deja Voom 2019: Night 1
    ######SETLIST:
    

  2. Use capitalization and proper spelling (just do your best - weird artist names are forgivable)

  3. Enter songs by using a un-ordered list - example: 
    
        * Rude Kid - Are You Ready?
    * Deckscar - Faceoff (Bassnectar - Cozza Frenzy acapella)
    * Svdden Death - Junkworld
    * The Fugitives - Samurai
    * Kid Sister - Pro Nails (Rusko Remix)
    * Bangladesh - 100 Loop
    

  4. If there is a mashup of two songs commonly recognized as played together, please use the following formatting: 
    
        Eptic - Death x Code: Pandorum - The Order Mashup
    

  5. Please reference lyrics as "acapella" or "lyrics", not "accappellass", "lyrics over top", "lyrics mashed in" etc

  6. Unknown songs should try and provide detail where possible. Try and reference lyrics in case someone later comes across your setlist and recognizes them. If no information is known, please just put ID - ID.

  7. Reference the Family Photo in the set using the following code: 
    
        ######FAMILY PHOTO
    

  **Thank you** for your help making this archive possible!
